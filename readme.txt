Our project code has two part, backend and frontend. To run backend, you can use these instructions:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd apps
python app.py

To run frontend, you need:
cd frontend

If the cse machine does not have npm and Node.js, you need install it by:
npm install -g npm

then: 

npm install

to install the dependency

finally run:
npm start

to start the frontend
